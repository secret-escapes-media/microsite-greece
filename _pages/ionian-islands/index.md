pre-intro: It’s been a long wait, but iconic summer getaways are starting to re-open. But where to go?
intro: Clutching to the northwest of the mainland, the Ionian islands are an unrivalled mix of outstanding island beauty and bustling, beautiful towns waiting to be explored. The cooler climate fosters verdant sprawls of forests and olive and cypress trees, and the water’s edge promises some of the best beaches in Greece. The Italians, French and British all laid claim to the islands over the decades, and this fusion of tastes and styles can still be found in the architecture and food; it’s these things that really set the Ionian islands apart. So if you’re planning that first, long-awaited getaway, there’s no better place to start than this remarkable island chain.

    type: large
    title: Corfu
    description: Once a stop-off for a wearied Odysseus, Corfu is an iconic destination that has topped the list of go-to Greek islands for decades. Away from the party capital to the south, the rest of Corfu is an enchanting mix of mountain villages, Venetian fortresses, stunning coastline and cosmopolitan flair. With a principal town that offers fashionable shopping, cafes and cocktails, Corfu mixes elegant towns with jaw-dropping countryside and coastline. The top half of the island faces Albania, which culture hounds can take full advantage of.

        id: corfu-town
        description: Bookended by twin mountains that host vast fortresses, Corfu Town is a maze of Venetian marble and terracotta splendour. Boutique shopping and the finest restaurants on the island hide amongst the effortlessly picturesque streets, offering days of exploration. From museums to cocktail bars, Corfu Town is a glamorous starlet of the Ionian Islands.
      - title: Old Perithia
        id: old-perithia
        description: An enchanting ghost town, Old Perithia is a mountain village left largely abandoned. Crumbling Venetian buildings leave gaps filled by the rolling hills of the surroundings, making for stunning views. A handful of tavernas offer delicious mountain fare in an irresistibly charming setting. Old Perithia also acts as a great base camp for a hike to the top of Mount Pantokrator.
      - title: Kassiopi
        id: kassiopi
        description: This charming north coast town has been a go-to resort since Roman times, with emperor’s Tiberius and Nero both having visited. Its historic popularity belies its small-town beauty, with a small picturesque harbour peaked by a Byzantine ruin of a castle. A small selection of tavernas and bars offer romantic evenings following days on exquisite beaches nearby.
      - title: Angelokastro
        id: angelokastro
        description: Peering out from its lofty position atop a hilly outcrop, Angelokastro treats any visitor to sublime views over the deep-blue sea and rocky coastline. Climb to the acropolis and wander through the thick defences of this Byzantine castle, a pivotal defender during Turkish invasion. It’s a formidable sight of kind of stoic grandeur, with views to die for.
      - title: Paleokastritsa Beach
        id: paleokastritsa-beach
        description: Some of the finest beaches in Greece are found in Corfu and the collection of Paleokastritsa are the best on the island. This stretch of coast features typically stunning Greek beaches, where transparent waters break onto white sands. Tavernas line the front for refreshing bites in gorgeous surroundings. Check out Lagrotta for diving, a rocky outcrop framed by cliffs that is simply mesmerizing.
      - title: Canal d’Amour
        id: canal-d-amour
        description: Paleokastritsa may have the most gorgeous beaches on Corfu, but Canal d’Amour is so unique it certainly stands to contest that other beach idyll. Two juts of land fling forward into the sea, creating a small canal of water with a quaint beach on one end. The name derives from the tradition that couples who swim down the canal will soon be married. Explore hidden swim-in caves, and relax in the startling beauty of this coastline.

  - id: kefalonia
    type: large
    title: Kefalonia
    description: A truly beautiful Ionian island, Kefalonia retains much of its rural charms. This authentic slice of Greek heaven has been spared from vast developments, offering true Greek glamour at every turn. It’s unsurprising, therefore, that it was used as the setting for Captain Corelli’s Mandolin – the picturesque surroundings perfectly frame the romance in the film. A rugged, mountainous interior spills out to flowing vineyards, finished by quiet coves that hide gorgeous beaches. For true, dare we say authentic island delights, head to Kefalonia.
    pois:
      - title: Argostoli
        id: argostoli
        description: As the 1953 earthquake flattened the town, Argostoli was rebuilt with smart pedestrianised streets that now offer stylish shopping, interspersed by the soft rumble of cafes hosting gossiping yayás. Plateia Valianou is awash with diners and in the summer is alive with the sound of guitars and mandolins from busking Kantadoroi, singing traditional songs that impart a romance over this charming town.
      - title: Myrtos Beach
        id: myrtos-beach
        description: One of Greece’s most stunning beaches, Myrtos lies at the bottom of vast limestone walls. A cherished beauty spot, take the meandering path down the steep slopes and sink back into a sunlounger on this sublime stretch of sand.
      - title: Robola Winery
        id: robola-winery
        description: A cooperative of vineyards high in the verdant mountains above Argostoli harvest a rather special grape. Said to have been introduced by the Venetians, the Robola grape is pressed to create a unique, dry white that is a must-try when in Kefalonia.
      - title: Assos
        id: assos
        description: A stupendously charming village that straddles a quiet bay, with delightful restaurants offering superlative waterfront dining. Head to the looming peninsula that juts into the sea and walk to the acropolis along tree-lined paths with stunning views over the deep-blue waters. At the top you’ll find the Castle of Assos, which again offers prime views over the Ionian.

    type: medium
    title: Zakynthos
    subtitle: Unparalleled beauty awaits
    description: Zakynthos - or Zante as it is also known - has the unfortunate ability of conjuring images of package holidays and big, concrete developments. Commercialisation may have hit a corner in the southeast of the island, but it’s relatively simple to avoid. The interior and northern coastlines are wild, untamed and simply stunning. Sample locally made olive oil and wine in small village shops, explore mountainside towns and sprawling cypress-covered valleys, for an effortlessly-charming rural experience. In Zakynthos Town, strut old town squares trimmed in neoclassical style, bouncing between lively bars and delicious restaurants. Its rich culture and arcaded streets make the town a glamorous destination for fashionable Ionian explorers.

  - id: lefkada
    type: small
    title: Lefkada
    description: Lefkada remains relatively untouched by tourists, yet offers a landscape as beautiful as any in the Ionian. The western coastline hides some stunning beaches, whereas the interior sees shepherds tending to their flock and villages that time seemingly forgot. Connected to the mainland and with a great capital town to explore, Lefkada is a great Ionian pick.

  - id: ithaca
    type: small
    title: Ithaca
    description: An enchanting island that floats in the gap between Kefalonia and the mainland, Ithaca is a place of  myths and legends. Odysseus’ home, where Penelope tricked an army of suitors waiting on his eventual return, Ithaca plays to these ancient stories in the ruins that have been unearthed across the small island. Legends aside, it’s also effortlessly beautiful, with dream-like beaches lapped by azure waters - no wonder Odysseus was so keen to return.

  - id: paxos
    type: small
    title: Paxos
    description: The smallest island chain in the Ionian is a true gem. Created by Poseidon as he thrust his trident into the sea off of Corfu, Paxi offers sleepy Italianate harbour villages, ancient olive groves and breathtaking beaches. It’s smaller neighbour, antipaxos, is known for its stellar wine. Grottoes and caves direct small boats to hidden beaches, where back on land seafood is freshly served in a handful of great restaurants.

  - id: kythera
    type: small
    title: Kythera
    description: If you’re looking for a secluded spot, don’t overlook the remote island of Kythera. It may need a little extra planning to get to, but you’ll be rewarded with a choice of isolated, gorgeous beaches, hidden-away mountain villages to explore, and breathtaking inland gorges studded with flowing waterfalls. The main town offers old-world Greek charms, with traditional restaurants, handmade crafts, and a Venetian fortress keeping watch.

  - id: meganisi
    type: small
    title: Meganisi
    description: This small island just off the coast of Lefkada is a serene idyll perfect for a relaxing escape. Quiet coves and pretty beaches are a given, with the small port towns offering waterfront dining for unforgettable sunset evenings. Even if you visit for a day from Lefkada, Meganisi is guaranteed to woo with its wonderfully slow pace; a perfect treat for that first island escape.

  - id: mathraki
    type: small
    title: Mathraki
    description: This lush island off the coast of Corfu is well off the beaten tourist path. A relatively low number of Corfu day-trippers delight at the peace found on this verdant island, with overnighters staying to get away from it all. There’s not much in the way of transport across the island, adding to that untamed quality. It’s a perfect destination for rural hikes to secluded beaches, where you can find your very own private paradise.
