    description: The Cretan landscape is one of contrasts. Wild and rugged peaks lie south, dotted with a patchwork of idyllic mountain villages, whereas close to shore, ancient harbour towns buzz with activity and stunning coastlines shelter irresistible beaches. Its size is a unique asset, making it a truly diverse island getaway. A big island with a bigger heart, you’ll find treasures like the sublime Samaria Gorge, the pink beaches of Elafonisi, and delectable dining crafted with local artisanal produce. From bustling cities to laid-back coastal towns, Crete has a little something for everyone.

        id: rethymno
        description: Labyrinthine streets are shrouded by canopies of flowering vines, with Ottoman minarets and Venetian balconies completing a picturesque scene. Rethymno is filled with fine restaurants, bars and boutiques, hidden amongst pretty narrow alleyways. A student population ensures a network of cool bars with live music, drawing crowds that spill out onto the streets after sunset. It’s one of the island’s finest cities.
      - title: Agios Nikolaos
        id: agios-nikolaos
        description: A stylish town built around an enchanting lagoon, Agios Nikolaos has long been a firm favourite of jet-set holiday-makers. With luxury boutiques contending with rustic tavernas and buzzing bars, there’s no shortage of activity from day to well into the night. Dine right next to the water, under the lights of the bars and restaurants that fringe the lagoon.
      - title: Pink Beaches
        id: pink-beaches
        description: At the western tip of Crete lie two rather special beaches, once known only to locals. Balos and Elafonisi each stretch across warm lagoons, perfect for shallow dips in remarkably clear waters. Yet the true marvel comes from the sublime pink hues that both beaches emanate – a technicolour wonder, which is by all accounts stupendously rare, that has to be seen to be believed.
      - title: Minoan Heritage
        id: minoan-heritage
        description: Crete was the home of Europe’s first advanced civilization – the Minoans. Their history can be found across the island, in palaces and settlements that are startlingly ancient. From the marvel of Europe’s oldest city, Knossos, where myths of the minotaur still reverberate around the palace walls, to the remarkable palace at Phaistos, the Minoans leave a mythical mark on the culture of Crete.
      - title: Balos
        id: balos
        description: A sublime beauty spot, Balos is an isolated lagoon beach where shallow, transparent waters wash over soft white sands. To reach it, a boat excursion or a trip in a 4x4 along dusty paths is necessary. The journey is worth it and certainly thrilling in its own right, and the twisting lagoon makes for a perfect day of beach lounging in idyllic surroundings.
      - title: Iraklio Wine Country
        id: iraklio-wine-country
        description: This famed wine region is home to a cluster of must-visit wine estates. Cretan grape varieties produce wines known for their refined and sumptuous qualities, slowly garnering deserved recognition outside of Crete. Hop from cellar-door tasting to cellar-door tasting, stopping off at a string of acclaimed restaurants as you discover this irresistible part of Cretan life.

    title: Rhodes
    description: The largest of the Dodecanese islands, Rhodes marries a rich history with enticing towns, gorgeous beaches, untouched forests and traditional Greek charm from top to bottom. Whether you’re going for endless sun lounging on crisp, white sands, or you prefer exploring Byzantine cities and imposing knights’ fortresses, Rhodes is one of those places that has a little something for everyone. Explore the medieval warrens of old towns, or drop in to sleepy, rural villages where family-run tavernas serve veritable feasts. The culture of Rhodes is marked by generations of change, with influences from myriad other cultures – the evidence for this lies in the incredible architecture, delicacies and flavours of the island.

      - title: Rhodes Old Town
        id: rhodes-old-town
        description: It’s the largest medieval city in Europe, a famed UNESCO heritage site, and, in a word, stunning.

        id: lindos
        description: Take a boat trip to Lindos, a small town with abundant charm. From the picturesque beach, the colourful houses wrap around the grand Acropolis, crowned by a fortification, ancient temple and breathtaking views. A warren of narrow streets reveal architectural clues of Lindos’ history – find Turkish, Frankish, Byzantine and much older styles all represented here. Cafes and tavernas hide in the patchwork of cobbled lanes, offering ample opportunity to indulge oneself as you climb to the summit.
      - title: Tsambika Monastery
        id: tsambika-monastery
        description: This old monastery looms high above a pretty beach, perched on a steep rock right next to the coast. It’s a famous pilgrimage spot for local women, who make the epic climb (sometimes crawling on hands and knees) to pray for fertility, often leaving an offering in the form of a wax baby at the altar; it’s these offerings, piled into a basket next to beautiful old frescoes, that add a peculiar touch to the site. A 298-step hike rewards with truly astounding views, with the beach below perfect for winding down after your very own pilgrimage.
      - title: Valley of the Butterflies
        id: valley-of-the-butterflies
        description: A ravishing beauty spot lies in the hills just south of Rhodes Town, set for inspired outdoor adventuring. This enchanting place, sheltered by trees and dotted with rivers and waterfalls, attracts a colourful collection of butterflies from June until September. A truly magical outing, don’t miss this one.

    title: Kos
    subtitle: An island of two halves
    description: This second largest of the Dodecanese is a vibrant mix of ancient history, stunning beaches, buzzing nightlife and effortless relaxation. Kos is a landscape of two halves. The majority of the island is flat, making it perfect for long cycle rides exploring quiet villages. The southern coastline however, rises dramatically; beaches share mountainous backdrops, and delicacies are found in remote mountain villages. Kos Town, like the rest of the island, is filled with ancient finds. Corinthian columns rise out of the urban scene, rubbing shoulders with Roman mosaics and Venetian knights’ castles. Italianate buildings and public gardens are joined by minarets, an architectural display of the many cultures that have left their mark on the island. Kos caters to many tastes – enjoy the nightlife of Kos Town or find your own quiet island retreat, all within easy reach of one another.

    title: Symi
    description: Those that arrive to Symi by ferry will be in awe of the beauty of the waterfront buildings. A colourful menagerie of Italianate mansions, all burnt orange and sandy hued, create a dazzling display for visitors that arrives by sea. Gorgeous beaches are to be found everywhere, though the centre of life remains in the three main towns. A truly beautiful destination that should be more than just a day trip from Rhodes.

    type: small
    title: Nisyros
    description: Nisyros is an island of wild beauty. It rises steeply out of the sea forming a ring of mountains that, upon closer inspection, form a lunar-like caldera. On the outer edge of the volcanic centre sit pretty whitewashed towns, filled with rustic charm. Beyond, view-laden hikes, pretty secluded beaches and enviable harbour life await.

  - id: kalymnos
    type: small
    title: Kalymnos
    description: Kos’s neighbour is a mountainous treasure, where peaceful pastoral scenes abound; its greatest draw is its potential for idyllic outdoor adventure. The working hub of Pothia isn’t particularly touristy, yet the island’s true delights lie in the quiet villages to the south. For private beaches, peaceful towns and local delicacies like squid in ouzo, Kalymnos makes a great stop.
