  <p>Completely different to the Cycladic islands, the Ionian show a strong Italian influence. Visit Corfu’s Pontikonisi island, or enjoy local delicacies like Numbulo, a distinctive ham from smoked pork fillet, and Sicomada, a kind of cake prepared with dried figs, almonds, orange skin, pepper, cinnamon, wine and ouzo. Delicious!</p>

      <p>Once a stop-off for a wearied Odysseus, Corfu is a resplendent destination that has topped the list of go-to Greek islands for decades. Away from the gaudy party capital to the south, the rest of Corfu is an enchanting mix of mountain villages, Venetian fortresses, stunning coastline and cosmopolitan flair. With a principal town that offers fashionable shopping, cafes and cocktails, Corfu mixes elegant towns with jaw-dropping countryside and coastline. </p>

  - title: Kefalonia

      <p>A truly beautiful Ionian island, Kefalonia retains much of its rural charms. The diggers and bulldozers have luckily spared the island from vast developments, offering true Greek glamour at every turn. It’s unsurprising, therefore, that it was used as the setting for Captain Corelli’s Mandolin – the picturesque surroundings perfectly frame the romance in the film. A rugged, mountainous interior spills out to flowing vineyards, finished by quiet coves that hide gorgeous beaches. For true, dare we say authentic island delights, head to Kefalonia.</p>

  - title: Zakynthos

      <p>Another typically beautiful Ionian pearl, Zakynthos, or Zante as it is also known, is often deserving of the moniker ‘schizophrenic’. Commercialisation has hit the southeast of the island, yet it’s relatively simple to avoid. The interior and northern coastlines are wild, untamed and simply stunning. Sample locally made olive oil and wine in small village shops, explore vertiginous towns and sprawling cypress-covered valleys – all in their wild, untamed and dramatic glory. Zakynthos Town offers neoclassical stylings, vast squares and a dominating fortress on a nearby hill. Lively bars and restaurants host buzzing evenings as the hot sun sinks beneath the startlingly turquoise sea.  </p>

  - title: Lefkada

      <p>Lefkada remains relatively untouched by tourists, yet offers a landscape as beautiful as any in the Ionian. The western coastline hides some stunning beaches, whereas the interior sees shepherds tending to their flock and villages that time forgot. Connected to the mainland and with a great capital town to explore, Lefkada is a recommended Ionian pick.</p>

  - title: Ithaca
    class: ithaca
    hierarchy: 3
    content: >
      <p>An enchanting island that floats in the gap between Kefalonia and the mainland, Ithaca whispers myths and legends in the ears of travellers who visit its white-sand and azure-water coastline. Odysseus’ home, where Penelope tricked an army of suitors waiting on his eventual return, Ithaca plays to these ancient stories in the ruins that have been unearthed across the small island. Legends aside, it’s effortlessly beautiful – a mystical jewel in the Ionian chain.</p>

  - title: Paxos
    class: paxos
    hierarchy: 3
    content: >
      <p>The smallest island chain in the Ionian is a true gem. Created by Poseidon as he thrust his trident into the sea off of Corfu, Paxi offers sleepy italianate harbour villages, ancient olive groves and breathtaking beaches. It’s smaller neighbour, Antipaxos, is known for its stellar wine. Grottoes and caves direct small boats to hidden beaches, where back on land seafood is freshly served in a handful of great restaurants.</p>
