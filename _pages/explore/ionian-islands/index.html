    type: large
    title: Corfu
    description: Once a stop-off for a wearied Odysseus, Corfu is a resplendent destination that has topped the list of go-to Greek islands for decades. Away from the gaudy party capital to the south, the rest of Corfu is an enchanting mix of mountain villages, Venetian fortresses, stunning coastline and cosmopolitan flair. With a principal town that offers fashionable shopping, cafes and cocktails, Corfu mixes elegant towns with jaw-dropping countryside and coastline.

      - title: Corfu Town
        id: corfu-town
        description: Bookended by twin mountains that host vast fortresses, Corfu Town is a maze of Venetian marble and terracotta splendour. Boutique shopping and the finest restaurants on the island hide amongst the effortlessly picturesque streets, offering days of exploration. From museums to cocktail bars, Corfu Town is a glamorous starlet of the Ionian Islands.
      - title: Old Perithia
        id: old-perithia
        description: An enchanting ghost town, Old Perithia is a mountain village left largely abandoned. Crumbling Venetian buildings leave gaps filled by the rolling hills of the surroundings, making for stunning views. A handful of tavernas offer delicious mountain fare in an irresistibly charming setting. Old Perithia also acts as a great base camp for a hike to the top of Mount Pantokrator.
      - title: Kassiopi
        id: kassiopi
        description: This charming north coast town has been an age-old resort since Roman times, with Tiberius and Nero both having visited. That said, it retains a charm and beauty, with a small picturesque harbour peaked by a Byzantine ruin of a castle. A small selection of tavernas and bars offer romantic evenings following days on exquisite beaches nearby.
      - title: Angelokastro
        id: angelokastro
        description: Peering out from its lofty position atop a hilly outcrop, Angelokastro treats any visitor to sublime views over the deep-blue sea and rocky coastline. Climb to the acropolis and wander through the thick defences of this Byzantine castle, a pivotal defender during Turkish invasion. It’s a formidable sight of stoic grandeur, with views to die for.
      - title: Paleokastritsa Beach
        id: paleokastritsa-beach
        description: Some of the finest beaches in Greece are found in Corfu and the collection of Paleokastritsa are the best on the island. This stretch of coast features typically stunning Greek beaches, where transparent waters break onto white sands. Tavernas line the front for refreshing bites in gorgeous surroundings. Check out Lagrotta for diving, a rocky outcrop framed by cliffs that is simply mesmerizing.
      - title: Canal d’Amour
        id: canal-d-amour
        description: Paleokastritsa may have the most gorgeous beaches on Corfu, but Canal d’Amour is so unique it certainly stands to contest that other beach idyll. Two juts of land fling forward into the sea, creating a small canal of water with a quaint beach on one end. The name derives from the tradition that couples who swim down the canal will soon be married. Explore hidden swim-in caves, and relax in the startling beauty of this coastline.

  - id: kefalonia
    type: large
    title: Kefalonia
    description: A truly beautiful Ionian island, Kefalonia retains much of its rural charms. This authentic slice of Greek heaven has been spared from vast developments, offering true Greek glamour at every turn. It’s unsurprising, therefore, that it was used as the setting for Captain Corelli’s Mandolin – the picturesque surroundings perfectly frame the romance in the film. A rugged, mountainous interior spills out to flowing vineyards, finished by quiet coves that hide gorgeous beaches. For true, dare we say authentic island delights, head to Kefalonia.
    pois:
      - title: Argostoli
        id: argostoli
        description: As the 1953 earthquake flattened the town, Argostoli was rebuilt with smart pedestrianised streets that now offer stylish shopping, interspersed by the soft rumble of cafes hosting gossiping yayás. Plateia Valianou is awash with diners and in the summer is alive with the sound of guitars and mandolins from busking Kantadoroi, singing traditional songs that impart a romance over this charming town.
      - title: Myrtos Beach
        id: myrtos-beach
        description: One of Greece’s most stunning beaches, Myrtos lies at the bottom of vast limestone walls. A cherished beauty spot, take the meandering path down the steep slopes and sink back into a sunlounger on this sublime stretch of sand.
      - title: Robola Winery
        id: robola-winery
        description: A cooperative of vineyards high in the verdant mountains above Argostoli harvest a rather special grape. Said to have been introduced by the Venetians, the Robola grape is pressed to create a unique, dry white that is a must-try when in Kefalonia.
      - title: Assos
        id: assos
        description: A stupendously charming village that straddles a quiet bay, with delightful restaurants offering superlative waterfront dining. Head to the looming peninsula that juts into the sea and walk to the acropolis along tree-lined paths with stunning views over the deep-blue waters. At the top you’ll find the Castle of Assos, which again offers prime views over the Ionian.

  - id: zakynthos
    type: medium
    title: Zakynthos
    subtitle: Sheer Beauty Awaits
    description: Another typically beautiful Ionian pearl, Zakynthos, or Zante as it is also known, is a firm favourite amongst holiday-makers. Commercialisation has hit the southeast of the island, yet it’s relatively easy to avoid if you’d prefer. The interior and northern coastlines are wild, untamed and simply stunning. Sample locally made olive oil and wine in small village shops, explore vertiginous towns and sprawling cypress-covered valleys – all in their wild, untamed and dramatic glory. Zakynthos Town offers neoclassical stylings, vast squares and a dominating fortress on a nearby hill. Lively bars and restaurants host buzzing evenings as the hot sun sinks beneath the shimmering turquoise sea.

  - id: lefkada
    type: small
    title: Lefkada
    description: Lefkada remains relatively untouched by tourists, yet offers a landscape as beautiful as any in the Ionian. The western coastline hides some stunning beaches, whereas the interior sees shepherds tending to their flock and villages that time forgot. Connected to the mainland and with a great capital town to explore, Lefkada is a recommended Ionian pick.

  - id: ithaca
    type: small
    title: Ithaca
    description: An enchanting island that floats in the gap between Kefalonia and the mainland, Ithaca whispers myths and legends in the ears of travellers who visit its white-sand and azure-water coastline. Odysseus’ home, where Penelope tricked an army of suitors waiting on his eventual return, Ithaca plays to these ancient stories in the ruins that have been unearthed across the small island. Legends aside, it’s effortlessly beautiful – a mystical jewel in the Ionian chain.

  - id: paxos
    type: small
    title: Paxos
    description: The smallest island chain in the Ionian is a true gem. Created by Poseidon as he thrust his trident into the sea off of Corfu, Paxi offers sleepy italianate harbour villages, ancient olive groves and breathtaking beaches. It’s smaller neighbour, Antipaxos, is known for its stellar wine. Grottoes and caves direct small boats to hidden beaches, where back on land seafood is freshly served in a handful of great restaurants.
