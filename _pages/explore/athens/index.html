        description: The heart of ancient Athenian life, the Agora was the centre for commerce, politics and socialising. Scattered ruins and the remarkable Hephaisteion lie stoic in wild flowers and shady trees, offering respite from busy Athens.

    - title: Bios Terrace
      id: bios-terrace
      description: Luckily, roof-terrace bar in Athens isn’t a byword for tasteless furniture, awful music and overpriced drinks. Instead, it means watching the sun set behind the Acropolis, atop a multi-level leftfield arts space that hosts gallery space and outdoor film screenings alike. Urban chic abounds as you sip on ice-cream cocktails (yes) listening to the finest chillout sounds this side of the Balearic Islands.
    - title: Couleur Locale
