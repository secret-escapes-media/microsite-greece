  <p>I love the buzz of Athens. Sit by Zonars coffee shop and watch the world go by, or walk on the cobble paths around the Acropolis and imagine Socrates teaching in the Agora. I recommend you take the tram for under €2 and go to Glyfada. Have a Frappé in one of the many cafes and explore the numerous boutiques in this charming area!</p>

      <p class="p--lead">It turns out you can have the best of both worlds. The Apollo Coast, known as the Athenian Riviera owing to its proximity to the capital, is awash with urban seaside charms.</p>
      <p>Once the stomping ground of wealthy Athenian socialites seeking the perfect summer getaway, you’ll find Greek island character only a short ride from the electric capital. Chic cocktail bars and boutique hotels characterise the style of the place, where endless beaches offer glorious azure waters that Greece is so known for. For a holiday that encompasses a bit of everything, the Athenian Riviera is a mighty fine fit. </p>
