  <p>An area for all tastes, lush forests and sandy beaches await in Halkidiki. Once there you must visit Thessaloniki and enjoy a stroll around Ladadika, an area full of restaurants and bars where you can taste local specialities like Bougatsa, a delicious cream pie. A personal favourite is Vergina, the underground ruins and burial site of King Philip, Alexander the Great's father. </p>
  <p>Hire a car to see the most of the Peloponnese, from Nafplion to Olympia, passing through historic Sparta. Visit Kalamata and enjoy an ouzo accompanied by the famous olives from the region for an authentic taste of the Peloponnese.</p>

      <p>An area of countless myths and legends that swirl and dance on the lips of locals in mountain villages and permeate the atmosphere of this Greek jewel. The Peloponnese are studded with ancient history, yet this tapestry encompasses a host of great civilizations throughout the years. This translates to a rich mix of Mycenaean palaces, Ottoman fortresses, Venetian splendour and more, offering heavyweight cultural exploits and typical Greek beauty from the snowcapped mountains down to the singing azure waters of this glorious coastline. Delectable Greek cuisine and a famed wine region offers the best of the best – it’s no surprise locals are fiercely protective of their offerings. Expect only the finest in the Peloponnese. </p>

      <p>The three-fingered limb of Northern Greece is a patchwork of quiet coves, white-sand beaches and lush, rolling forests that climb the hills and mountains of this fertile region. With three peninsulas to explore, Halkidiki offers everything from brash nightclubs to isolated monastic living – a tale of two extremes. Explore rolling vineyards and try local wines, or kick-back in exquisite seafood restaurants in Sithonia. The birthplace of Aristotle has drawn archaeologists to a plethora of historic sites, whereas Athos remains a centre of Greek Orthodox spiritualism, where simple monasteries cling high on the rocks of the mountainside. Explore the rocky trident, and immerse yourself in a relatively unspoilt, wild-flower and thick-forest Greece. </p>

  - title: Mountains
    subtitle: Elevate your Greek experience

      <p>Jutting peaks frame the spine of mainland Greece. You’ll find some of the oldest natural woods in Europe, sublime valleys cut by twinkling streams, and a host of outdoor pursuits for those that love to explore the nature scene. Visit the utterly beguiling Meteora, which rises on a looming pinnacle of rock which it peaks with monastic splendour. Don’t miss the Askitaria, the hollows carved into the flat rock face where monks would climb to and isolate themselves. Traverse ancient stone bridges that cross flowing rivers. Pick from a collection of sublime national parks, perfect for wistful walks in epic surroundings. Find sunny hillside villages, stop off at tavernas, and relax in this little travelled part of Greece.</p>

  - title: Thessaloniki

    content: >
      <p>Greece’s second city is an upbeat, riotous medley of history, a thriving night scene, and leading art and urban cool. Pick from trendy bars and forward-looking eateries, waterfront cocktail spots and stoic ancient monuments. Young, vibrant and packed with cultural exploits, Thessaloniki is a strong rival to Athens.</p>

  - title: Pelion

      <p>This forgotten corner of Greece offers true escapism. Rural life offers serene private beaches, mountain villages, glorious local produce for truly refined dining, and very few tourists. A place where centaurs roamed, Jason left in search of the fleece, Achilles trained, it’s a mythical land not only for the stories but for its retention of timeless, preserved and authentic Greek charms.</p>

  - title: Delphi
    class: delphi
    hierarchy: 3
    content: >
      <p>When Zeus released two eagles from opposite ends of the earth, this is where they met. Delphi was the ancient heart of Greece, of the world in fact. Looming over the steep slopes of Mt Parnassos, Delphi evokes a drama, seemingly revelling in the mysticism of its location that was home to the famed oracle. The views are jaw-dropping, framed by the remarkable archaeology – the amphitheatre, the lone standing columns, all facing a deep valley of rolling olive and cypress trees and distant mountains.</p>
