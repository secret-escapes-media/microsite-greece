  - id: peloponnese
    type: large
    title: Peloponnese
    description: An area of countless myths and legends that swirl and dance on the lips of locals in mountain villages and permeate the atmosphere of this Greek jewel. The Peloponnese are studded with ancient history, yet this tapestry encompasses a host of great civilizations throughout the years. This translates to a rich mix of Mycenaean palaces, Ottoman fortresses, Venetian splendour and more, offering heavyweight cultural exploits and typical Greek beauty from the snowcapped mountains down to the singing azure waters of this glorious coastline. Delectable Greek cuisine and a famed wine region offers the best of the best – it’s no surprise locals are fiercely protective of their offerings. Expect only the finest in the Peloponnese.

      - title: Nafplio
        id: nafplio
        description: The first capital of the new Greek state, Nafplio is lauded as an effortlessly romantic port town that typifies esteemed Greek charms. Elegant Venetian heritage mixes with neoclassical mansions and smart marbled streets, hosting a plethora of cafes, rich boutiques and fine restaurants. It remains a peaceful, not-too-touristy Peloponnese gem.
      - title: Olympia
        id: olympia
        description: Birthplace of the Olympics, ancient Olympia saw one-thousand years of the games before the site was sacked by the Romans. Explore the stadium, palaestra and gymnasium, imagining oiled men and shrieking onlookers of the games’ furore – you’ll have to, as there is unfortunately not much left aside from foundations. Helpfully, a few grand columns of the Temple of Zeus have been rebuilt to impart a sense of scale – useful, when picturing one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that used to stand here – the magnificent, gargantuan statue of Zeus, built on-site at Pheidias’ workshop.
      - title: Mycenae
        id: mycenae
        description: Mycenae, the ancient walled citadel once home to famed King Agamemnon, speaks of a remarkably ancient Greece – dating as far back as the 6th millennium BC. Walk through the imposing walls of the citadel, under the iconic Lion Gate. See the ruined palace, the grave circles and the Cult Centre, where remarkably artistic finds now shelter in the local museum.
      - title: Monemvasia
        id: monemvasia
        description: A vast, towering spit of rock lies barely off the coast, a magnificent display that pierces the sky and shelters a walled Byzantine town. Cross the narrow causeway from the town of Gefyra and discover Ottoman, Venetian and Byzantine influence in this age-old place. Explore narrow, labyrinthine streets and relax in charming tavernas, with views to die for.
      - title: Corinth
        id: corinth
        description: Corinth is a startling mix of Greek and Roman archaeology in remarkable condition, forming the gateway to the Peloponnese. The incredible 5th century BC Doric temple frames the home of philosopher Diogenes (who famously told Alexander the Great to move out of the way of his sunlight whilst he was living in a barrel), Jason of the Argonauts, and visits from St Paul and Roman traveller Pauselius. Remarkable preservation brings these myths and legends to life – an unmissable stop.
      - title: Theatre of Epidaurus
        id: theatre-of-epidaurus
        description: One of the finest ancient Greek theatres in existence, this vast, sweeping amphitheatre is a 3rd century BC marvel. Its design produces remarkable acoustics, a fact best tried out during the Hellenic Festival, where you can view a performance in this ancient theatre. A must for a truly authentic experience.

  - id: halkidiki
    type: large
    title: Halkidiki
    description: The three-fingered limb of Northern Greece is a patchwork of quiet coves, white-sand beaches and lush, rolling forests that climb the hills and mountains of this fertile region. With three peninsulas to explore, Halkidiki offers everything from brash nightclubs to isolated monastic living – a tale of two extremes. Explore rolling vineyards and try local wines, or kick-back in exquisite seafood restaurants in Sithonia. The birthplace of Aristotle has drawn archaeologists to a plethora of historic sites, whereas Athos remains a centre of Greek Orthodox spiritualism, where simple monasteries cling high on the rocks of the mountainside. Explore the rocky trident, and immerse yourself in a relatively unspoilt, wild-flower and thick-forest Greece.

      - title: Afitos
        id: afitos
        description: The most splendid village in Halkidiki, Afitos is a picturesque fishing village of cobbled streets and aged churches. Head to the beach or kick-back in a taverna for rich local eats in utterly charming surroundings. Sitting shelved above the coast means Afitos offers some truly irresistible views of the coastline.
      - title: Stageira
        id: stageira
        description: A spread of crumbling ruins lie on a headland on the eastern shore of Halkidiki. In some ways, this is not the most remarkable of Greece’s ancient site. However, this was the birthplace of Aristotle. His statue peers over his home across the Aegean. Certainly worth a pilgrimage.
      - title: Mt Athos boat trip
        id: mt-athos-boat-trip
        description: The third spit of land in Halkidiki is solely dedicated to monastic life, with the remarkable caveat of no visitors. Particularly no women (though men can apply six months previously for a pass - no words). The cliff hugging monasteries are utterly beguiling though, with a boat trip around the peninsula taking full advantage of their sheer beauty.
      - title: Kriopigi
        id: kriopigi
        description: A sleepy rural village laden with cobbles and endless charms. A main square offers a colourful selection of tavernas and bars, which make for excellent people watching and romance as the sun sets. The beach is pretty and quiet, making Kriopigi a great stop for relaxed Greek living.

    type: medium
    title: Mountains
    subtitle: Elevate Your Greek Experience
    description: Jutting peaks frame the spine of mainland Greece. You’ll find some of the oldest natural woods in Europe, sublime valleys cut by twinkling streams, and a host of outdoor pursuits for those that love to explore the nature scene. Visit the utterly beguiling Meteora, which rises on a looming pinnacle of rock which it peaks with monastic splendour. Don’t miss the Askitaria, the hollows carved into the flat rock face where monks would climb to and isolate themselves. Traverse ancient stone bridges that cross flowing rivers. Pick from a collection of sublime national parks, perfect for wistful walks in epic surroundings. Find sunny hillside villages, stop off at tavernas, and relax in this little travelled part of Greece.

  - id: thessaloniki
    type: small
    title: Thessaloniki
    description: Greece’s second city is an upbeat, riotous medley of history, a thriving night scene, and leading art and urban cool. Pick from trendy bars and forward-looking eateries, waterfront cocktail spots and stoic ancient monuments. Young, vibrant and packed with cultural exploits, Thessaloniki is a strong rival to Athens.

  - id: pelion
    type: small
    title: Pelion
    description: This forgotten corner of Greece offers true escapism. Rural life offers serene private beaches, mountain villages, glorious local produce for truly refined dining, and very few tourists. A place where centaurs roamed, Jason left in search of the fleece, Achilles trained, it’s a mythical land not only for the stories but for its retention of timeless, preserved and authentic Greek charms.

  - id: delphi
    type: small
    title: Delphi
    description: When Zeus released two eagles from opposite ends of the earth, this is where they met. Delphi was the ancient heart of Greece, of the world in fact. Looming over the steep slopes of Mt Parnassos, Delphi evokes a drama, seemingly revelling in the mysticism of its location that was home to the famed oracle. The views are jaw-dropping, framed by the remarkable archaeology – the amphitheatre, the lone standing columns, all facing a deep valley of rolling olive and cypress trees and distant mountains.
