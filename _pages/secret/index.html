    title: Syros
    description: "Syros, a small and wonderfully charming island and also the capital of the Cyclades, has long been overlooked as just a ferry terminal for exploring the northern islands. The capital city may be bustling, but outside of this grandiose hub the island life is remarkably rural. In this way, Syros achieves something quite remarkable; it offers a culturally-charged centre from which idyllic pastoral life spreads along the hills and gorgeous coastline of the island. As you arrive in Ermoupoli, pastel neoclassical mansions rise to a hilltop summit, capped with a pretty blue-domed church. The effect is impressive, setting the tone for an adventure through narrow cobbled streets, where cultural treasures and delicious tavernas await. Beaches across the island are sweet, serene and quiet, fringing a mountainous landscape of farmsteads, old churches and sleepy villages. Back in town, renowned delis offer island delicacies. Theatre, art and history fill grand buildings, forming a trail of unique cultural experiences. Syros seemingly offers everything a traveller could wish for, a secret that won’t stay quiet for long. Visit the island before word gets out..."

        description: A view of Ermoupoli from the sea is one that rouses undeniable wanderlust. The grandiose buildings stack on top of each other, rising to the medieval quarter of Ano Syros. It’s a climb to the summit, but  you’ll be rewarded with gorgeous panorama. Explore the beautiful cathedral, the nearby Byzantine museum, and the Orthodox quarter on the next hill. Back in the town, life revolves around the grand Plateia Miaouli, where you can kick back with a drink and watch the Syros life sink into sunset.

        description: There’s plenty of foodie treats hidden in Ermoupoli and beyond. Whilst in the city, get a good sense for what’s on offer at Chios street, where traditional food shops vie for your gastro-sensibilities. Take a stroll and come away with a bottle of delicious local wine, accompanied by local cheeses like the renowned San Michali. Don’t miss the island’s fennel sausage, loutza, before heading to Miaoulis square for the iconic sweet treats loukoumia, chalvadopita and nougat pie that deck the counters of tempting sweet shops.

    title: Sifnos
    description: Pretty Sifnos remains overlooked by travellers to the Cycladic sprawl; it’s a sleepy island where quiet coves and sheltered beaches remain unspoilt, lapped by the invitingly clear Aegean. It embodies the rustic island-charm that first brought holiday-seekers to the islands in the 60s. Shoreline whitewashed villages, irresistibly Greek, shelter foodie gems amongst their winding lanes. Cooking is part of the culture, as is pottery. It signals the laid-back lifestyle you can expect here; in the off-season, hike across the island and pass sleepy villages and Mycenaean citadels, or head for sunshine and find your very own beach paradise. The taverna is nearby, there’s no real reason to move for the whole day. Sifnos is just one of those islands – it teaches you what simple pleasures really are. Therein lies the secret to Greece’s island charm. Discover it for yourself.

        description: A truly remarkable medieval village clings to a rocky outcrop, peaked by an old Venetian fortress. Follow the winding trail to the outer walls, passing under the gate and entering a narrow, covered and cobbled street that is, in a word, astonishing. Whitewashed homes connected by strange overhead walkways are interrupted by ancient Roman sarcophagi, which seem almost littered amongst the streets. Head through this mesmerising scene, past cafes and tavernas, until you reach the far end of the town – look down over the coast and the isolated, blue-domed chapel that sits on the next peak.

        description: It may surprise you, but this unassuming island is known as the cradle of Greek cooking. Greek gastro hero Nikolaos Tselementes hailed from this beautiful rock, becoming the country’s first celebrity chef. No surprise then, that Sifnos reels with pride in its cooking. Even the simplest rituals, the sunday clay pots of chickpea soup, are bursting with flavour and locally foraged ingredients. Head for beachside tavernas for fresh seafood, let your sweet tooth guide you to family bakeries stocked with loukoumi and more, and prepare to gorge on a sumptuous feast of island cooking.

        id: hiking
        description: Sifnos is connected by a number of hiking trails that criss-cross the island. If you’re visiting in the off-season – because summer sun can make these hikes a little too intense – there really is no better way to see all that Sifnos has to offer. Not only is the hinterland wonderfully picturesque, but many of the trails are very, very old. Pilgrim’s trails connect old churches and pretty villages that time seemingly forgot. Stumble upon ancient sites, discover pastoral life, and find quiet, remote parts of the island away from the tourist trail. Sifnos Trails is the best online resource for unlocking your hike.
