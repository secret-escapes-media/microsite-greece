  Greece is one of those places that deserves a lifetime of exploration. An endless sea of bewitching islands and a mainland of mountains, myths and myriad adventures await. Yes, the beaches are gorgeous, some of the best in Europe in fact, and yes, the landscapes are uniquely beautiful; but behind the azure waters and olive-grove valleys thereâ€™s a culture as old as time waiting to be unpicked, presenting itself in the local fare of roadside tavernas, in the hidden ruins of lost civilizations, and in the warm hospitality of the Greek people, your local guides to the idiosyncrasies of each tempting destination.
